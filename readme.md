# Sample Size Checking for Mirabile

This directory contains the work involved in checking the sample size calculations that have been performed for the Fetus-Mirabile Health Technology Assessment Expression Of Interest submission.

The original sample size calculations was performed by [Mike Bradburn](mailto:m.bradburn@sheffield.ac.uk) using [Stata](https://www.stata.com/) and have been replicated using the code within this repository using [R](https://www.r-project.org/).
